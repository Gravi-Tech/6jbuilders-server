## Migrating from v1

For the most part, migrating from v1 takes minimal effort as v2 still supports factory creation of proxy connections with callback support.

### Notable breaking changes

- In an options object, the proxy 'command' is now required and does not default to 'connect'.
- **In an options object, 'target' is now known as 'destination'.**
- Sockets are no longer paused after a SOCKS connection is made, so socket.resume() is no longer required. (Please be sure to attach data handlers immediately to the Socket to avoid losing data).
- In v2, only the 'connect' command is supported via the factory SocksClient.createConnection function. (BIND and ASSOCIATE must be used with a SocksClient instance via event handlers).
- In v2, the factory SocksClient.createConnection function callback is called with a single object rather than separate socket and info object.
- A SOCKS http/https agent is no longer bundled into the library.

For informational purposes, here is the original getting started example from v1 converted to work with v2.

### Before (v1)

```javascript
var Socks = require('socks');

var options = {
    proxy: {
        ipaddress: "202.101.228.108",
        port: 1080,
        type: 5
    },
    target: {
        host: "google.com",
        port: 80
    },
    command: 'connect'
};

Socks.createConnection(options, function(err, socket, info) {
    if (err)
        console.log(err);
    else {
        socket.write("GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: google.com\n\n");
        socket.on('data', function(data) {
            console.log(data.length);
            console.log(data);
        });

        // PLEASE NOTE: sockets need to be resumed before any data will come in or
